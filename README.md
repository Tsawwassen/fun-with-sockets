## Weekend Project, Fun with Sockets
Create a simple chat app

## Goal
Use sockets to allow users in a chat room to communicate 

## Plan of action
1. Follow a tutorial to understand socket objects
2. Create frontend interface
3. Create backend to send and receive socket messages (? not sure if messages is the right word)
*Note, not sure if its better to make frontend before backend atm, might switch steps.

## Post Weekend Project Comments


## Motivation
After doing a lot of request / response projects, I wanted to try using sockets. The last time I've used sockets was in a Java class at Langara.
I expect the backend to be similar to the Java class, but the frontend (React) will be a new challenge (used handlebars view engine in the class).

## Features
- Node Express backend
- React frontend
- Sockets

## Code Example / Misc things I learned during the project


## Installation
run 'npm run install' from project root

## How to use?
run 'npm run client' to start the React client
run 'npm run server' to start the Node Express server
*Dev note, I enjoy having 1 console open for the server and another open for the client, which is why I don't have a command to run both
